# Goals

## Focus

Understandability -> Reading and understanding of code should be as easy as possible. \
Predictability -> Surprises are bad, determinism is good. \
Safety -> Type and memory safety help preventing errors; to shoot oneself in the foot should be explicit. \
Performance -> As fast as possible without sacrificing understandability, predictability or safety.

## Hierarchy of fundamentals

Type safety \
Memory safety \
Performance \
Simplicity \
Elegancy

## Preferences

Compile time cost over run time cost \
Simple zero-cost abstractions over powerful heavy-cost abstractions
