# Memory Management

## Previous ideas

This section contained ideas about and ownership model of stack and heap objects that defined functions and objects as owners. The two versions played around the idea of passing objects "down", "up" or "away" from the stack and having a single owner that may only pass references down the stack or ownership pyramid. \
These ideas are still available in the git history but are discarded for now.
